    """
    Retrieve indices of source boxes that are neighbors to the reference box.

    Parameters:
    src_boxes (np.ndarray): An array of bounding boxes with shape (N, 4),
                            where N is the number of boxes and each box is represented
                            by [x1, y1, x2, y2].
    ref_box (np.ndarray): A single bounding box represented by [x1, y1, x2, y2].

    Returns:
    list: A list of indices of the source boxes that are close to the
          reference box based on the intersection area.
