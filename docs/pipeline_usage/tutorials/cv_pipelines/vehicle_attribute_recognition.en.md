# Vehicle Attribute Recognition Pipeline Tutorial

## 1. Introduction to Vehicle Attribute Recognition Pipeline
Vehicle attribute recognition is a crucial component in computer vision systems. Its primary task is to locate and label specific attributes of vehicles in images or videos, such as vehicle type, color, and license plate number. This task not only requires accurately detecting vehicles but also identifying detailed attribute information for each vehicle. The vehicle attribute recognition pipeline is an end-to-end serial system for locating and recognizing vehicle attributes, widely used in traffic management, intelligent parking, security surveillance, autonomous driving, and other fields. It significantly enhances system efficiency and intelligence levels, driving the development and innovation of related industries.

<b>The vehicle attribute recognition pipeline includes a vehicle detection module and a vehicle attribute recognition module</b>, with several models in each module. Which models to use can be selected based on the benchmark data below. <b>If you prioritize model accuracy, choose models with higher accuracy; if you prioritize inference speed, choose models with faster inference; if you prioritize model storage size, choose models with smaller storage</b>.

## 2. Quick Start
The pre-trained models provided by PaddleX can quickly demonstrate results. You can experience the effects of the vehicle attribute recognition pipeline online or locally using command line or Python.

### 2.1 Online Experience
Not supported yet.

### 2.2 Local Experience
Before using the vehicle attribute recognition pipeline locally, ensure you have installed the PaddleX wheel package according to the [PaddleX Local Installation Tutorial](../../../installation/installation.en.md).

#### 2.2.1 Experience via Command Line
You can quickly experience the vehicle attribute recognition pipeline with a single command. Use the [test file](https://paddle-model-ecology.bj.bcebos.com/paddlex/imgs/demo_image/vehicle_attribute_002.jpg) and replace `--input` with the local path for prediction.

```bash
paddlex --pipeline vehicle_attribute_recognition --input vehicle_attribute_002.jpg --device gpu:0
```
Parameter Description:

```bash
{'res': {'input_path': 'vehicle_attribute_002.jpg', 'boxes': [{'labels': ['red(红色)', 'sedan(轿车)'], 'cls_scores': array([0.96375, 0.94025]), 'det_score': 0.9774094820022583, 'coordinate': [196.32553, 302.3847, 639.3131, 655.57904]}, {'labels': ['suv(SUV)', 'brown(棕色)'], 'cls_scores': array([0.99968, 0.99317]), 'det_score': 0.9705657958984375, 'coordinate': [769.4419, 278.8417, 1401.0217, 641.3569]}]}}
```

For the explanation of the running result parameters, you can refer to the result interpretation in [Section 2.2.2 Integration via Python Script](#222-integration-via-python-script).

The visualization results are saved under `save_path`, and the visualization result is as follows:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cuicheng01/PaddleX_doc_images/refs/heads/main/images/pipelines/vehicle_attribute_recognition/01.jpg"/>


#### 2.2.2 Integration via Python Script
* The above command line is for quick experience and viewing of results. Generally, in projects, integration through code is often required. You can complete the pipeline's fast inference with just a few lines of code. The inference code is as follows:

The results obtained are the same as those from the command line method.

In the above Python script, the following steps are executed:

(1) The vehicle attribute recognition production line object is instantiated via `create_pipeline()`. The specific parameter descriptions are as follows:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Parameter</th>
<th>Parameter Description</th>
<th>Parameter Type</th>
<th>Default Value</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>pipeline</code></td>
<td>The name of the production line or the path to the production line configuration file. If it is the name of a production line, it must be supported by PaddleX.</td>
<td><code>str</code></td>
<td>None</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>device</code></td>
<td>The device used for production line inference. It supports specifying the specific card number of GPUs, such as "gpu:0", other hardware card numbers, such as "npu:0", and CPUs, such as "cpu".</td>
<td><code>str</code></td>
<td><code>gpu:0</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>use_hpip</code></td>
<td>Whether to enable high-performance inference. This is only available if the production line supports high-performance inference.</td>
<td><code>bool</code></td>
<td><code>False</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

(2) The `predict()` method of the vehicle attribute recognition production line object is called to perform inference prediction. This method returns a `generator`. Below are the parameters and their descriptions for the `predict()` method:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Parameter</th>
<th>Parameter Description</th>
<th>Parameter Type</th>
<th>Options</th>
<th>Default Value</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tr>
<td><code>input</code></td>
<td>The data to be predicted. It supports multiple input types and is required.</td>

<li><b>List</b>: Elements of the list must be of the above types, such as <code>[numpy.ndarray, numpy.ndarray]</code>, <code>["/root/data/img1.jpg", "/root/data/img2.jpg"]</code>, <code>["/root/data1", "/root/data2"]</code>.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</td>

<td><code>float | dict | list | None</code></td>
<td>
<ul>
<li><b>float</b>: A uniform threshold for attribute recognition.</li>
<li><b>list</b>: For example, <code>[0.5, 0.45, 0.48, 0.4]</code>, which means different thresholds for different classes in the order of <code>label list</code>.</li>
<li><b>dict</b>: The key is <code>default</code> or <code>int</code> type, and the value is a <code>float</code> threshold. For example, <code>{"default": 0.5, 0: 0.45, 2: 0.48, 7: 0.4}</code>. <code>default</code> represents the uniform threshold for attribute recognition, while other <code>int</code> types apply specific thresholds to classes with cls_id 0, 2, and 7.</li>
<li><b>None</b>: If set to <code>None</code>, the default value from the production line initialization will be used, initialized to <code>0.7</code>.</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td><code>0.7</code></td>
</tr>
</table>

3) Process the prediction results. Each sample's prediction result is of type `dict`, and supports operations such as printing, saving as an image, and saving as a `json` file:

<table>

</thead>
<tr>

<tr>
<td><code>indent</code></td>
<td><code>int</code></td>
<td>Specify the indentation level to beautify the output <code>JSON</code> data, making it more readable. This is only effective when <code>format_json</code> is <code>True</code>.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>ensure_ascii</code></td>
<td><code>bool</code></td>
<td>Control whether to escape non-<code>ASCII</code> characters to <code>Unicode</code>. If set to <code>True</code>, all non-<code>ASCII</code> characters will be escaped; <code>False</code> will retain the original characters. This is only effective when <code>format_json</code> is <code>True</code>.</td>
<td><code>False</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>save_to_img()</code></td>
<td>Save the result as an image file.</td>
<td><code>save_path</code></td>
<td><code>str</code></td>
<td>The file path to save the result, supporting both directory and file paths.</td>
<td>None</td>
</tr>
</table>

- When calling the <code>print()</code> method, the result will be printed to the terminal. The printed content is explained as follows:

    - `input_path`: `(str)` The input path of the image to be predicted.
    - `boxes`: `(List[Dict])` The category IDs of the prediction results.
    - `labels`: `(List[str])` The category names of the prediction results.
    - `cls_scores`: `(List[numpy.ndarray])` The confidence scores of the attribute prediction results.
    - `det_scores`: `(float)` The confidence scores of the vehicle detection boxes.

- When calling the <code>save_to_json()</code> method, the above content will be saved to the specified <code>save_path</code>. If a directory is specified, the saved path will be <code>save_path/{your_img_basename}.json</code>. If a file is specified, it will be saved directly to that file. Since JSON files do not support saving numpy arrays, the <code>numpy.array</code> type will be converted to a list format.
- When calling the <code>save_to_img()</code> method, the visualization result will be saved to the specified <code>save_path</code>. If a directory is specified, the saved path will be <code>save_path/{your_img_basename}_res.{your_img_extension}</code>. If a file is specified, it will be saved directly to that file. (In production, there are usually many result images, so it is not recommended to specify a specific file path directly; otherwise, multiple images will be overwritten, and only the last image will be retained.)

* Additionally, it also supports obtaining visualized images with results and prediction results through attributes, as follows:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Attribute</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1"><code>json</code></td>
<td rowspan="1">Get the prediction result in <code>json</code> format</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="2"><code>img</code></td>
<td rowspan="2">Get the visualized image in <code>dict</code> format</td>
</tr>
</table>

- The prediction result obtained through the `json` attribute is of type `dict`, and its content is consistent with the result saved by the `save_to_json()` method.
- The prediction result returned by the `img` attribute is a dictionary. The key `res` corresponds to the value of an `Image.Image` object: a visualized image displaying the attribute recognition result.

Additionally, you can obtain the vehicle attribute recognition pipeline configuration file and load the configuration file for prediction. You can execute the following command to save the result in `my_path`:

```bash
paddlex --get_pipeline_config vehicle_attribute_recognition --save_path ./my_path
```

If you have obtained the configuration file, you can customize the settings for the OCR production line by simply modifying the `pipeline` parameter value in the `create_pipeline` method to the path of the configuration file. The example is as follows:

```python
from paddlex import create_pipeline

pipeline = create_pipeline(pipeline="./my_path/vehicle_attribute_recognition.yaml")

output = pipeline.predict(
    input="./vehicle_attribute_002.jpg",
)
for res in output:
    res.print()
    res.save_to_img("./output/")
    res.save_to_json("./output/")

```

<b>Note:</b> The parameters in the configuration file are initialization parameters for the production line. If you wish to change the initialization parameters for the vehicle attribute recognition production line, you can directly modify the parameters in the configuration file and load the configuration file for prediction. Additionally, CLI prediction also supports passing in a configuration file by specifying the path of the configuration file with `--pipeline`.

## 3. Development Integration/Deployment

If the production line meets your requirements for inference speed and accuracy, you can proceed directly with development integration/deployment.

If you need to integrate the production line into your Python project, you can refer to the example code in [2.2.2 Python Script Method](#222-python-script-method).

In addition, PaddleX also provides three other deployment methods, which are detailed as follows:

🚀 <b>High-Performance Inference</b>: In practical production environments, many applications have strict standards for the performance metrics of deployment strategies, especially response speed, to ensure efficient system operation and smooth user experience. To this end, PaddleX offers a high-performance inference plugin aimed at deeply optimizing the performance of model inference and pre/post-processing, significantly speeding up the end-to-end process. For detailed high-performance inference procedures, please refer to the [PaddleX High-Performance Inference Guide](../../../pipeline_deploy/high_performance_inference.en.md).

☁️ <b>Service-Oriented Deployment</b>: Service-oriented deployment is a common form of deployment in practical production environments. By encapsulating inference capabilities into services, clients can access these services via network requests to obtain inference results. PaddleX supports various production line service-oriented deployment solutions. For detailed production line service-oriented deployment procedures, please refer to the [PaddleX Service-Oriented Deployment Guide](../../../pipeline_deploy/serving.en.md).

Below are the API references for basic service-oriented deployment and multi-language service invocation examples:

<br/>

📱 <b>Edge Deployment</b>: Edge deployment is a method of placing computing and data processing capabilities directly on user devices, allowing them to process data locally without relying on remote servers. PaddleX supports deploying models on edge devices such as Android. For detailed instructions, please refer to the [PaddleX Edge Deployment Guide](../../../pipeline_deploy/edge_deploy.en.md).
You can choose the appropriate deployment method based on your needs to integrate the model production line into your AI application.

## 4. Secondary Development
If the default model weights provided by the vehicle attribute recognition production line do not meet your requirements in terms of accuracy or speed, you can attempt to <b>further fine-tune the existing models using your own domain-specific or application-specific data</b> to improve the recognition performance of the vehicle attribute recognition production line in your scenario.

### 4.1 Model Fine-Tuning
Since the vehicle attribute recognition production line includes both a vehicle detection module and a vehicle attribute recognition module, if the performance of the production line is not satisfactory, the issue may lie in either of these modules. You can analyze the images with poor recognition results to determine which module is problematic and refer to the corresponding fine-tuning tutorial links in the table below for model fine-tuning.

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Scenario</th>
<th>Fine-Tuning Module</th>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Inaccurate attribute recognition</td>
<td>Vehicle Attribute Recognition Module</td>
<td><a href="../../../module_usage/tutorials/cv_modules/vehicle_attribute_recognition.en.md">Link</a></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<b>Note:</b> The parameters in the configuration file are initialization parameters for the production line. If you wish to change the initialization parameters for the vehicle attribute recognition production line, you can directly modify the parameters in the configuration file and load the configuration file for prediction. Additionally, CLI prediction also supports passing in a configuration file by specifying the path of the configuration file with `--pipeline`.

## 3. Development Integration/Deployment

If the production line meets your requirements for inference speed and accuracy, you can proceed directly with development integration/deployment.

If you need to integrate the production line into your Python project, you can refer to the example code in [2.2.2 Python Script Method](#222-python-script-method).

PaddleX supports various production line service-oriented deployment solutions. For detailed production line service-oriented deployment procedures, please refer to the [PaddleX Service-Oriented Deployment Guide](../../../pipeline_deploy/serving.en.md).

Below are the API references for basic service-oriented deployment and multi-language service invocation examples:

```bash
pipeline_name: vehicle_attribute_recognition

SubModules:
  Detection:
    module_name: object_detection
    model_name: PP-YOLOE-L_vehicle
    model_dir: null
    batch_size: 1
    threshold: 0.5
  Classification:
    module_name: multilabel_classification
    model_name: PP-LCNet_x1_0_vehicle_attribute
    model_dir: null
    batch_size: 1
    threshold: 0.7
```

Subsequently, you can load the modified pipeline configuration file using the command line or Python script methods described in the local experience section.

## 5. Multi-Hardware Support
PaddleX supports a variety of mainstream hardware devices, including NVIDIA GPU, Kunlunxin XPU, Ascend NPU, and Cambricon MLU. <b>Simply modify the `--device` parameter</b> to seamlessly switch between different hardware.

For example, if you are using Ascend NPU for vehicle attribute recognition inference, the Python command is as follows:

```bash
paddlex --pipeline vehicle_attribute_recognition \
        --input vehicle_attribute_002.jpg \
        --device npu:0
```

If you want to use the general OCR production line on a wider range of hardware devices, please refer to the [PaddleX Multi-Hardware Usage Guide](../../../other_devices_support/multi_devices_use_guide.en.md).
